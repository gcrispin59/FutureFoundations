# The American Renewal Covenant
## Future Foundations PAC Candidate Pledge Framework

*"America is not a place, but an idea—and ideas require stewards willing to stake their careers on their convictions."*

---

## Covenant Overview

The **American Renewal Covenant** represents a revolutionary approach to political accountability where candidates don't just make promises—they stake their political futures on measurable commitments to governance reform. By allowing candidates to self-nominate their metrics and consequences, we create a market-based system of political integrity that rewards ambition and punishes mediocrity.

### Core Principle
**Aspirational America**: The understanding that American democratic institutions represent humanity's highest political aspirations, deserving stewards who will sacrifice personal advancement to preserve and renew these foundations for future generations.
