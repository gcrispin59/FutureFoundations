## **Certification Training: Credit System for Political Candidates**

FutureFoundations.org offers a comprehensive Certification Training program designed for political candidates at local, state, and federal levels. This program provides essential knowledge and practical strategies for building resilient communities and effectively managing disaster risk. Candidates can earn a "Credential in Resilient Governance" by accumulating sufficient credit points across various learning modules.

### **Credentialing Pathways:**

* **Core Modules:** A foundational set of modules required for all candidates, covering essential principles of disaster management and policy.  
* **Specialized Tracks:** Candidates can choose specialized modules relevant to their specific political office or areas of interest (e.g., Urban Resilience, Rural Flood Mitigation, Coastal Adaptation, Infrastructure Policy). Not all modules are required for the credential, allowing for tailored learning paths.

### **Credit Point System:**

Each learning module is assigned a specific number of credit points, reflecting its depth, complexity, and importance.

* **Module Completion:** Candidates earn full credit points upon successful completion of a module, which typically includes reviewing content, participating in discussions, and passing a knowledge assessment (e.g., quizzes, case study analyses).  
* **Prior Learning Assessment (PLA):** We recognize that political candidates often bring significant prior education, professional experience, or life experience. Candidates can apply for credit for prior learning through:  
  * **Portfolio Review:** Submission of relevant policy briefs, legislative actions, community projects, or professional certifications related to disaster management, urban planning, engineering, or public administration.  
  * **Challenge Exams:** For specific modules, candidates may opt to take a challenge exam to demonstrate their existing knowledge and earn credit without going through the full learning participation.  
  * **Experiential Learning Documentation:** Detailed documentation of significant leadership roles or direct involvement in disaster response, recovery, or mitigation efforts.

### **Credit Points for "Understanding Inaction: Biases, Influence, and Incentives in Disaster Preparedness"**

This module is a critical component of the "Core Modules" pathway, providing fundamental insights into the human and political dynamics of disaster preparedness.

* **Credit Points:** **5 Points**

This module's 5 credit points reflect its foundational importance in equipping candidates with a nuanced understanding of the non-technical barriers to resilience, which is crucial for effective policy-making and community leadership.
