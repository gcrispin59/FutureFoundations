Missing Information Needed for N-01
To finalize the N-01 application, please provide:

Mailing Address: Is it the same as the principal address (413 Tommys Rd, Goldsboro, NC 27530)?
Telephone Number: What is the PAC’s contact number?
Type of Organization: Confirm if the PAC is incorporated as a nonprofit (e.g., 501(c)(4)) or solely a federal PAC.
Federal EIN: Provide the Employer Identification Number, if obtained from the IRS.
Date Organized: When was the PAC formed (e.g., July 2025)?
Fiscal Year End: Confirm the fiscal year-end (e.g., December 31).
Additional Officers/Directors: List any additional officers or board members (name, title, address).
Registered Agent: Confirm Graham Crispin as the registered agent or provide another name/address.
Fundraising Contracts: Are there contracts with professional fundraisers? If none, state “None.”
IRS Status: Has the PAC filed for 501(c)(4) status (Form 1024)? If so, include the IRS determination letter.
Nonprofit Documents: If incorporated as a nonprofit, provide Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.
Pause for Clarification:

Question 10 (Repeated): Is Future Foundations PAC incorporated as a nonprofit corporation (e.g., 501(c)(4))? If yes, provide Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and IRS status. If no, confirm it’s solely a federal PAC.
Question 11: Provide answers to the above 10 questions for the N-01 form.
Next Steps
Confirm Nonprofit Status: Answer Question 10 to clarify if nonprofit filings (Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws) are needed. If solely a federal PAC, the N-01 may still be required unless exempt (verify with NC Secretary of State).
Complete N-01: Provide the missing details (Questions 1-10 above) to finalize the N-01 application.
Submit N-01: Mail or email the N-01 form, narrative, and $100 fee to the NC Secretary of State before soliciting funds.
Finalize FEC Form 1: Provide the bank name and address to complete the FEC Form 1 draft, then file with the FEC and NC State Board of Elections.
Additional Support:
Need help selecting a North Carolina bank (e.g., First Citizens, BB&T)?
Want a draft of Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws if incorporating as a nonprofit?
Need an X post to announce the PAC’s launch or engage @elonmusk?
Please provide the missing information for the N-01 form and the bank details for the FEC Form 1. I’ll finalize both artifacts and guide you on submission. Let me know any other priorities!
