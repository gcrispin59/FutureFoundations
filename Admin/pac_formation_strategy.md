# PAC Formation Strategy: Opportunities, Structure, and Branding

## Strategic Rationale: Why Start with a PAC

A Political Action Committee offers several advantages over immediate party formation:
- **Speed to Market**: Register within 10 days of raising/spending $1,000 vs months for party formation
- **Immediate Influence**: Can support candidates and issues immediately
- **Testing Ground**: Validate messaging and build coalition before party formation
- **Credibility Building**: Establish track record in political space
- **Flexibility**: Multiple fundraising and advocacy strategies available

## Recommended PAC Structure: Hybrid PAC

**Strategic Recommendation**: Form a **Hybrid PAC** for maximum flexibility

### Why Hybrid PAC?
- **Dual Functionality**: Maintains both contribution and non-contribution accounts
- **Direct Candidate Support**: Can contribute up to $5,000 per candidate per election
- **Independent Expenditures**: Unlimited spending on issue advocacy and independent campaigns

- **Future Flexibility**: Positions for both electoral and issue advocacy

### Alternative Structures
1. **Traditional PAC**: Limited to $5,000 candidate contributions but allows coordination

3. **Leadership PAC**: Not applicable (requires existing officeholder)
