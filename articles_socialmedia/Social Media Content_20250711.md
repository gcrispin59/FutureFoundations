## **TikTok / Reels (Video Concept/Script)**

**Concept:** Fast-paced visuals showing contrasting scenes: disaster aftermath vs. proactive mitigation, then seamless coordination. Use text overlays and trending audio.

**Visuals:**

* **0-3s:** Quick cuts: Flooded streets (e.g., Texas floods imagery), damaged homes, emergency responders looking overwhelmed. (Use stock footage or illustrative graphics).  
* **3-6s:** Transition to animated graphics: Three interlocking gears or puzzle pieces labeled "FEMA," "National Guard," "USACE."  
* **6-9s:** Show a resilient bridge being built, a dam under construction, or a community participating in a flood preparedness drill.  
* **9-12s:** Text overlay highlights: "Less Red Tape," "Faster Aid," "Smarter Mitigation."  
* **12-15s:** Show a graphic of a clear, accurate flood map vs. a distorted one.  
* **15-18s:** Final shot: FutureFoundationsPAC.org logo with the donation link prominently displayed.

**Audio (Upbeat, inspiring trending sound):**

* **Voiceover (energetic, clear):** "Disasters are hitting harder. Are we ready?"  
* **Voiceover:** "FutureFoundationsPAC.org believes in a united front\! FEMA, National Guard, Army Corps of Engineers â€“ working as one."  
* **Voiceover:** "No more local politics blocking vital flood protection. We need science, not gridlock\!"  
* **Voiceover:** "Help us build a stronger, safer America. Your support makes the difference."

**On-Screen Text Overlays:**

* "Disasters are Real."  
* "UNITE FOR RESILIENCE\!"  
* "FEMA \+ NG \+ USACE \= STRENGTH"  
* "No More NIMBY\!"  
* "Accurate Flood Maps NOW."  
* "BUILDING SAFER COMMUNITIES"  
* "FutureFoundationsPAC.org"  
* "DONATE: donate.futurefoundationspac.org"

**Caption/Description for TikTok/Reels:**

**Post 1 (Comprehensive Overview)**

**FutureFoundationsPAC.org**

The recent Texas floods of 2025 are a stark reminder: our nation needs a more unified and resilient approach to natural disasters. At FutureFoundationsPAC.org, we believe in deep integration between FEMA, the National Guard, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

Imagine:

* **FEMA** leading with streamlined coordination.  
* The **National Guard** providing rapid, pre-integrated support.  
* The **Army Corps of Engineers** building critical, resilient infrastructure like dams and bridges, with their expertise empowered to cut through local political obstacles and ensure accurate flood maps, unlike past challenges seen in places like Buncombe County, NC.

This isn't just about responding faster; it's about proactively building safer communities and ensuring every dollar is spent effectively. Less bureaucracy, more impact.

**Post 2 (Focus on Hazard Mitigation & Local Politics)**

**FutureFoundationsPAC.org**

Are local politics putting your community at risk? ðŸš§ We've seen it too often: critical hazard mitigation projects, like flood control dams or resilient roads, get blocked or distorted by "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) sentiments or developer interests. This was a factor in the devastating impacts of recent floods.

At FutureFoundationsPAC.org, we're fighting to empower the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to lead these vital projects with their impartial, science-based expertise. We need accurate flood maps, not politically manipulated ones, to truly protect our homes and lives.

It's time to prioritize public safety over short-sighted political agendas.

Learn how we can overcome these barriers and build truly resilient communities: \[Link to Policy Brief on your website\]
